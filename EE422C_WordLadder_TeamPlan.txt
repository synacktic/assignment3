Fall 2016

We both met and sat down together for the initial meeting to get the project started and get a general idea
of what we wanted to accomplish coding while we were not coding together.  Initially, we decieded that 
Michelle Tate would do the DFS module and Brian Sutherland would do the BFS module in order to prevent any
commit, merge, and sync issues.  We worked on these parts separately at first, communicating regularly
to update each other on the status of our part and to gather ideas on how to better implement our part.
We implemented some test cases of our own to ensure our methods worked before we met for the second time.

Once we had our getWordLadderDFS() and getWordLadderBFS() methods working, we met again to further work on
the unit testing and holistic project testing and debugging.  This resulted in us changing much of the Main
class methods, and hvaing to rewrite part of our own methods so that we could both use the necessary Main
methods (such a printLadder()) without any issues arising from one or both of our getWordLadderDFS() 
and getWordLadderBFS() methods.

Ten test cases were written by Michelle Tate and ten test cases were written by Brian Sutherland.
We spent approximately 8 hours together in the same room.
