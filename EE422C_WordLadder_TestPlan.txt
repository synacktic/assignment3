The testing goal was to ensure that each method within the DFS and BFS class worked correctly as individual 
units, as well as worked well as a whole.  Our methodology was to individually test
each separate method within the DFS and BFS classes by feeding the methods required inputs and evaluating if
the methods had the desired/expected outputs.  Therefore, we testing each module individually.  After we
ensured that each individual module performed as expected, we moved onto testing the program as a whole.

We used JUNIT for some of the test cases to ensure that our word ladders were not hopping more than one letter
at a time from one word to the next.  For other test cases, we sent multiple variations of the two word input
(the start and end word) to the getWordLadderDFS() and getWordLadderBFS() manually.

We covered:
	start word:	end word:		expected output:			DFS:	BFS:
	smart		start			should print 0-rung ladder		0	0
	smart 		smart			should print a 0-rung ladder		0	0	should not be tested
	smart 		yyyyy			should print no ladder exists		N/A	N/A
	smart 		money			should give some x-rung ladder		884	9
	xxxxx 		yyyyy			should print no ladder exists		N/A	N/A
	bumps		allee			should print no ladder exists		N/A	N/A
	homed		hooky			should print some x-rung ladder		62	2
	husky		bawls			should print some x-rung ladder		254	5

We did not cover:
	We did not attempt different words that were not five characters long.
	We did not attepmt two words that were outside of the requirement range.

1. JUNIT Test
a) checkLetterDifference
b) What feature does the test cover – 1-2 phrases or sentences.
	Checks for correct printing of a any sized ladder by ensuring that moving from one rung in the
	ladder to the next rung in the ladder always had exactly 1 letter change.
c) Set up for the test – initialization.
	Declared start and end word to send to the getWordLadderDFS() and getWordLadderBFS().
	Had a boolean flag that was initialized to true.  This flag was set to false if the
	letter difference from one run to the next rung was ever greater than one.
d) Expected output for a good module.
	Ladder between start word and end word with no ladder hops of more than a one letter difference.
e) The pass/fail criterion for the test.
	No stack overflow, ladder had no multiple letter changes from one rung to the next rung.
