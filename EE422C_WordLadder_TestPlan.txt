Test plan summary What was your goal, methodology, and conclusion?  1 paragraph.  Example:
Did you use JUNIT?  Did you test modules or the whole thing all at once?  What areas 
did you feel you covered in your final test suite?  What did you not cover?  

The testing goal was to ensure that each method within the DFS and BFS class worked correctly as individual 
units, as well as to test if the DFS and BFS worked as a whole.  Our methodology was to individually test
each separate method within the DFS and BFS classes by feeding the methods required inputs and evaluating if
the methods had the desired/expected outputs.  Therefore, we testing each module individually.  After we
ensured that each individual module performed as expected, we moved onto testing the program as a whole.

We covered:

We did not cover:


1. 
a) Test name (LONG_LADDER_DFS)
b) What feature does the test cover – 1-2 phrases or sentences.
	Checks for correct printing of a long ladder of over XXX words.
c) Set up for the test – initialization.
	None.
d) Expected output for a good module.
	Ladder between XXX and YYY.  Ladder checked for duplicate words.
e) The pass/fail criterion for the test.
	No stack overflow, ladder has no duplicates.  Ladder correct, as checked by 'ladder checker'.
f) Any comments, if any.
	Test is expected to run in 2 seconds or less.
